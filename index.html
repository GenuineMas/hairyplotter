            And (possibly) moving the mouse pointer with the eyes. And (possibly) feeling like Yoda.<br /><br />
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography">Electrooculography</a> is a beautiful concept that we stumbled upon during our Junior year of study, which was, in fact, so intuitively simple that we decided to whip up a little model by ourselves. So here's a Do-It-Yourself Electrooculogram we came up with. As a bonus, we wrote a little extendable framework over which you could write quasi-plugins (Mouse pointer movement and RC Car Navigation being ours).<br /><br />

                <h3>Premise.</h3>
                Straight out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrooculography">Wikipedia</a>: <br /><i>To measure eye movement, pairs of electrodes are typically placed either above and below the eye or to the left and right of the eye. If the eye moves from center position toward one of the two electrodes, this electrode "sees" the positive side of the retina and the opposite electrode "sees" the negative side of the retina. Consequently, a potential difference occurs between the electrodes. Assuming that the resting potential is constant, the recorded potential is a measure of the eye's position.</i><br /><br />
                In ELI5 terms, we're going to stick a bunch of electrodes across our eyes, and since they generate different potentials for different positions, we should be able to get an idea of the current position of the eyes based on the potential observed across them.
